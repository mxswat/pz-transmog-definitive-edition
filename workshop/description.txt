[h1] The definitive Edition of the transmog mod [/h1]
After months, I finally made a transmog mod that works in [b]single-player[/b] and [b]multiplayer[/b] without requiring complex setups and external dependencies. The real successor of my Fashionoid mod.

This version works out of the box and is compatible with [b]all clothing mods![/b]. And it supports and infinite amout of [b]modded and vanilla clothing! [/b]

[h1]Sandbox Option - Immersive Mode [/h1]
[b]When you enable the Immersive Mode from the sandbox settings, you can transmog only to the items you have found, and if you die, don't worry! You will keep your list of found transmogs :D[/b]
[h1]Sandbox Option - Limit Transmog To The Same Body Location[/h1]
[b]Eg: you can only transmog hats to hats, and trousers to trousers, but not trousers to hats, or different body locations. It defaults to 'Disabled'[/b]
[h1]Sandbox Option - Tailoring Level Requirement[/h1]
[b]You can now set a minimum tailoring level required for Transmog options to become available. It defaults to 0[/b]

[h1]Mods compatibility[/h1]
I tested this with various clothing mods, including Authentic Z, Brita Armor pack, Spongies Clothing, and even Anthro Survivors and more!.
This mod should be compatible with all clothing mods, but if any mod is not working then please report it in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2979375840/3827542174239583726/] Troubleshooting Discussion [/url]

[h1]READ ME: Know issues and limitations[/h1]
[b]-[/b] This mod works best on a new save and server. No guarantee that it work on existing saves, but it should be fine.
[b]-[/b] Opening the transmog menu will make the game lag a bit on lower-end PCs, this happens because the game is trying to load all the possible items.
[b]-[/b] Unsurprisingly, some items migth clip if you do weird transmogs, this is a limitation of the game engine.
