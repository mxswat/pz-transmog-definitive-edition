description=[h1]READ ME: Known issues and limitations[/h1]
description=[b]-[/b] This mod works best on a new save and server. No guarantee that it will work on existing saves, but it should be fine.
description=[b]-[/b] Opening the transmog menu will make the game lag a bit on lower-end PCs. This happens because the game is trying to load all the possible items.
description=[b]-[/b] Unsurprisingly, some items might clip if you do weird transmogs. This is a limitation of the game engine.
description=[b]-[/b] Revision 5 fixes the missing hats/helmet bugs!
