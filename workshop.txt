description=[h1]Mods compatibility: How to make mods compatible[/h1]
description=If you made a mod that adds BodyLocations, and you want to make it so that this mod does not hide them automatically, you can use this code in your mod as an example.
description=[code]if getActivatedMods():contains("TransmogDE") then
description=   require("TransmogDE");
description=else return end
description=TransmogDE.addBodyLocationToIgnore("Fur") -- Support for "the furry mod"
description=TransmogDE.addBodyLocationToIgnore("Face_Tattoo") -- Support for "elies tattoo" face tattoos
description=TransmogDE.addBodyLocationToIgnore("CustomBodyLocatioNameHere") -- Support for your "CustomBodyLocatioNameHere"

description=[h1] READ ME: Know issues and limitations[/h1]
description=[b]-[/b] To ensure your hair is visible when you hide your hat, I had to write code to edit all head gear, so if you see the wrong hat icons, or you don't see the hat visible on a zombie, this is why. You can disable this fix via the sandbox option "Disable Hat and Masks Hard Fix"
description=[b]-[/b] Item clipping, half visible models. That's a limitation of the game engine, and it can be fixed by unequipping an re-equipping the clipping item. This usually applies to backpacks.
description=[b]-[/b] This mod works best on a new save and server. No guarantee that it work on existing saves, but it should be fine.
description=[b]-[/b] Opening the transmog menu will make the game lag a bit, this happens because the game is trying to load all the possible items, this is not something I can fix.
description=[b]-[/b] Blood stains do not appear on clothings yet, and I'm still working on a fix.
